Remembering that a B-Tree is a particular (a,b) tree with a=[d/2] and b=d where a is the minimum number of children and d is the maximum one. We need to implement in order:

Node class
B-Tree Class which has 5 methods: Search, Fusion, Split, Insertion, Deletion.

On the book there’s no implementation of (a,b) tree nor B-Tree and professors don’t show it in slide.
So book can be helpful for theory and functional logic of an (a,b) but implementation must be developed.
An useful tool to check our result is a B-TREE visualizer and can be founded at https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html
A general idea of presentation of this exercise is to try different implementation and comment results choosing the best one.
Exercise require to optimize computational complexity in terms of I/O so  we need a tool(python or other way ) to test it.
Remember that python provides internal tool to execute different kind of tests.
