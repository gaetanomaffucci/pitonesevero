Exercise requires to implement a DFS graph visit iteratively.
Graph node implementation given by professor must be used.
Since we can modify node graph class itâ€™s useful to add a visited flag state and also information about backedge.
The algorithm ends when no longer nodes can be reached by starting point.
Take into account that we must divide the problem for directed graphs and undirected graphs.
